##### About

Visual spatial neglect is a common consequence of brain injury, in particular seen following injury to the right hemisphere. A symptom of neglect is impaired performance responding to information on the contra-lesional (left) side of the body. This is popularly assessed with cancellation tasks where the participant is asked to mark all the target items on a cluttered sheet of paper. This software allows you to quickly score performance on many popular cancellation tasks, or even allow you to create your own tests. It provides continuous scores for egocentric neglect (where individuals miss targets on one side of their body) using the method described by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20433859 Rorden et al., 2010]. It also provides a measure for allocentric neglect (missing items on the right side of the body) as described by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608082 Rorden et al., 2012].
